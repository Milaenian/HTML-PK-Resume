<p>I'm an easygoing and curious soul who finds joy in cricket matches, cinematic storytelling, and meaningful conversations. Whether it's the thrill of a game or the depth of a dialogue, I love tuning into what mattersâ€”on screen and in real life. I believe every story, whether spoken or played, deserves to be heard.</p>
